Cache each definition version's compute-extracted UI schema on the version row, and make schema extraction a hard upload gate.

`DefinitionVersion` gains optional `schema` + `schemaExtractedAt`, and `IDefinitionStore` gains `setVersionSchema`. On upload, the schema is now extracted and validated against Rhino.Compute **before** any blob or version row is written — a compute outage or a definition with no valid `Schema` output rejects the upload (503 / 422) with nothing persisted. The render path reads the cached schema instead of re-fetching it from compute on every load, falling back to a live fetch (plus a temporary solve-time backfill) for versions uploaded before this change.

`@selvajs/platform` now re-exports the `UISchema` type from `@selvajs/schemas` (types-only dependency). The Supabase provider adds a `0002` migration creating `definition_versions.schema` / `schema_extracted_at` (and the previously-missing `change_note`) columns.
